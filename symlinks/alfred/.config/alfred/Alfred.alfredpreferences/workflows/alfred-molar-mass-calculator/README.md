# alfred-molar-mass-calculator [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ariporad/alfred-molar-mass-calculator.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ariporad/alfred-molar-mass-calculator)

> Automatically compute the molar masses of molecules.


## Install

```
$ npm install --global alfred-molar-mass-calculator
```

*Requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 4+ and the Alfred [Powerpack](https://www.alfredapp.com/powerpack/).*


## Usage

In Alfred, type `molm <MOLECULAR FORMULA>` (for example, `molm NaOH` or `molm H2O`),
and the molar mass will be calculated. Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to copy the result
to your clipboard.
